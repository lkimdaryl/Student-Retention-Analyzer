# CSE151AProject
In this study, we will leverage the dataset titled, “Predict students dropout and academic” from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository, uploaded on December 12th, 2021. Our objective is to employ supervised learning, specifically utilizing various regression models and a neural network, to predict the success rates of students in higher education. The dataset has 36 potential features, which covers historical information such as age, gender, nationality, etc. Our approach involves training a model to predict the target variable (ie. success) based on these student profiles.
